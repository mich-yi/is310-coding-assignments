something Chad I I'm releasing a new


scientific Branch it's called


chipy all right I'm head you know I'm


head founder head scientist I think I


got Neil degrass Tyson coming on board


so he's going to be like my you know


right-and man in this but I'm releasing


a new um science called chology


right


um so Chad here are the things before I


tell y'all what the B what I think you


know what it's not even an option it's


the best chip in the world now okay


here's what makes a good chip chat tell


me if I miss something


texture


flavor Packaging


after taste aftertaste is a big one


and how much dust it leaves on your


hands did I miss


anything shape you know what yeah shape


let's throw that in there crunchiness I


mean no I feel like every chip is


crunchy but I say all that to say this


chat I think the biggest cutting up your


mouth well see if the chip is good


enough I'm willing I'm willing to take


that you know what I


mean


um all that to say I will say this


Pringles is not a chip


what what do you mean Pringles is not a


chip what are you talking


about


anyway I say y'all that GL to say this


chat and this isn't an opinion this is a


scientific fact because like I just said


what I'm about to say is back by science


right the best chip in the


world is regular


Takis okay and I don't think at this


point in my life I will ever go back on


that statement because like I said this


years of research has led up to this


years of research has led up to this


very moment and Chad I'm here to tell


you takis are the best chip that that


exist and probably ever will


exist you know what I mean jalapeno


chips are better they're just not though


they're just not better Miss Vicki's


jalapeno those are all right but they're


like that's what I'm going to grab when


I go into sub way or something yo Parker


with the five appreciate


you you


know Chad do you agree be honest hold on

this


um chips tier list dude how long has it


been since we did a tier list dude it


has


been it has been so long oh my goodness

one chat what do youall think about


this I feel like we could find a better


one right I mean they got veggie straws


on here I mean let's be


real it ain't that good there's better


chips than Takis what


veggie straws are good yeah when you're


when you have nothing else to eat so you


stumble into your pantry at 3:00 in the


morning and you dig through the very


bottom and in the very backhand corner


you find a expired bag from six months


ago sitting there and then you eat it


because you're hungry that's when


they're


good other than


that no Chad do we use this one or do


another one now let's do another one


this one's kind of mid


bro this one's kind of


mid hold

nothing the ultimate chip tier


list okay this is the dumbest thing I've

right


here this a great


list chat and everybody lock


in everybody lock in


okay first up what are these Cape Cod


original um now me being a chip


olist obviously I I can't reach all


corners of the


earth um so I must say that I've never


had a Cape Cod original so we're going


to have to go to the uh the board here


which is the


chat um chat where does Cap Cod original


go wow y'all are saying wow


really all right chat we're going to the


board we're going to the


board see CH are y'all cool being the


board members of a chology be hon honest


Cape Cod


original sa a oh


s


a b


c d


slf and if D slf is chosen y'all will


then further elaborate whether it's D or


F but I'll by I'll judge by looking at


chat K Cod original


chat


whoa wow those are


hated oh my goodness those are hated


dude


yo they're so hated that not only did D


slf win s is the least voted okay so


chat I'm going to ask the next question


which is what we have to ask does it go


in D or


F I'm GNA go by what letter I see most


in chat D or


F it is a


overwhelming majority


F wow


okay I guess that's how we're starting


it Off K cot original


go and F now Chad I'll have a take and


I'll put them where I where I think they


need to go but I can also turn to the


board and ask y'all to like vote on a


poll whether you agree or disagree right


so what do we have


here or original crunchy Cheetos you


can't go wrong you can't go wrong with


some original crunchy Cheetos


dude I mean they're are


classic a I see a whole lot of A's


now listen they're a classic they're


great but they're not s tier so that


being


said that being said yeah I think chat


y' y'all want to go a


here I'm down to go a


here Cheetos are mid who lied to you


buddy what you mean Cheetos or


mid a all right regular Cheetos and a


flaming hot Cheeto puffs that is a s I


don't care what anybody says flame and


hot Cheeto puffs are the second best hot


chip on the


planet they're they're too good Flamin


Hot Cheeto puffs and anybody that's


saying F you cannot be biased because


you don't like hot stuff so if you don't


like hot stuff just just sit this one


out because that's that's what's like


clouding your judgment at this


point I'm going s I'm going s with


flamin' hot Cheeto


puffs s and here we have Flamin Hot


Cheeto


crunchy so that begs the question does


Flamin Hot Cheeto crunchy deserve a s


right beside


it


s I will say this I agree throwing them


an S but I think Flamin Hot Cheeto puffs


are higher tier s so throw this in s


along with it but behind


it oh the jalapeno Cheeto crunchy


dude oh man those are


good dude I feel like B right


here


a y'all to go a with


this okay we'll go a they get old after


a while that's my exact reason that I


was going to put them in B because I've


had like five bags of these my whole


life and every time I ate them I grew


more tired of them so we'll put an A but


it'll wind up being like it'll wind up


being like what does that


add but yeah it'll wind up being like a


low a you know what I


mean what is this Flamin Hot Cheeto


lime oh so they're trying to be T okay I


can say I've never had flamin' hot


Cheeto


lime like at that point if you're going


to do that just eat Takis like I don't


understand


B this is another one I've never had


thus we have to turn to the board


Flamin Hot Cheeto lime vote


board s oh come on y'all are glazing


Cheetos at this point wait a minute it's


gonna be


be I agree I strongly agree with this so


I just typed in chat and said Chester


Cheeto is absolutely crushing

tell you to be like yo man Doritos nacho


cheese I got to throw these in s but in


recent years Doritos nacho cheese the


quality of the Chip And The dusting on


the chip has declined significantly back


in the day the chips would be completely


dusted in nacho cheese


nowadays you're lucky to get a couple


chips that are dusted in nacho cheese so


due to the quality of the chip I am


going to put these behind regular


crunchy Cheetos and


a


right yo Goofy with another


five wait


B you know what yeah I'm actually


willing to go B I actually willing to go


B front


B Doritos wait what is this


chat salsa verde I

CHS mix 100% right these are worse than


Che mix chat are these worse than cheex


Miss


missed they're


not you're right they're not works the


cheex mix so I'm going to put them in D


right in front of cheex mix matter of


fact I almost want to put cheex mix in


the back of f or no the front of


f no


know Doritos Spicy nacho these are good


these are good they are good but they


suffer from the same problem as regular


Doritos and lightly dusted not good


enough so front of B now these right


here Doritos Spicy Sweet


Chili I almost want to put Dorito spicy


sweet chili in s


like bro they're so


good like chat Dorito spicy sweet chili


back of s no not even the back of s I


want to put Dorito spicy sweet chili


right here that's where I want to put


them fight


me


100% they're so good


dude what is


this Chad are these just Dorito like


salsa chips like corn


chips yeah okay well due to that I'm


going to put it in like


d because it's just a it's just


a you


know right


F I'll put it in the front of f Chili


Cheese Fritos oh


my I think I'm putting chili cheese


Frito I'm putting chili cheese Frito in


s I'm putting Chili Cheese Fritos in s


100% I am the yeah I'm putting Chili


Cheese Fritos right here borderline you


know what you may not like me for this


but I'm putting them right here in front


of spicy tweet sweet chili uh uh


Doritos oh they're so good


man they're just


good you could throw them in a Fredo pie


you can do whatever by the way chat


these right here all these Brands right


here like from this point all the way


here I'm skipping these I've never heard


of them like we're skipping these we're


going to go to like right here so


because if we don't skip those we're


gonna be here all night but


okay original


Fritos you've lost it you're going to


sit here and tell me with a straight


face that uh uh Chili Cheese Fritos


aren't better than spicy twet sweet


chili


Doritos okay here we have regular Fritos


now this might be


another this might be another


controversial one


but hear me


out if I asked myself like say I walk


into the gas station right


chat and I see a bag of regular crunchy


Cheetos and I see a bag of regular


Fritos but side by side I am going to


grab the regular Fritos eight out of 10


times so due to that fact I think I put


Fritos in the middle of


a and if anybody saying F and if you


don't like regular Fritos like you going


to have to grow up a little bit because


they're good you grab some bean dip with


it too all you get some regular Fritos


and some bean dip oh I'm living


good I'm putting them


here Fritos twists aka the acid reflux


machine they are very good but they give


me acid reflux like crazy just like


every other barbecue chip does but if


we're going off taste quality of Chip


and


dusting I think these deserve a a as


well maybe a


s matter of fact chat hear me


out right there


now here's where the list is about to


get mixed


up


flaming hot


funions up until this


point this is the second best chip on


here so due to that fact this is going


top of s right behind Flamin Hot Cheeto


puffs straight up


straight up there's no way that the only


people that would disagree on


this is people who don't like spicy


stuff you know what I


mean in front dude


borderline no no they're not no they're


great chat funion Flamin Hot funion is


like a top 10 chip they're absolutely


amazing but are they better than flamin'


hot Cheeto puffs they're just not


they're just not better they're they're


great they're just not


better you know what I mean here we got


regular funions I honestly think this is


a s tier chip as well I would honestly


put Flamin Hot funions in s right in


front of um Frito flavor


twist yeah yeah okay I'm skipping all


these I've never heard of them I'm not


even going to bother lays baked okay can


we can we all agree to put every lay


baked chip and F can we just do


that can we just put every lays baked


variation of Chip and F because they're


not


good they're they're they're just not


good like honestly every lays baked I'm


throwing them I'm throwing them in F I


hate them I hate them dude


Lays barbecue okay my opinion these go f


as


well but obviously I'm just one person


here L take Chad I can't first off I


don't like the taste of barbecue second


off I can't have barbecue because it


messes my stomach


up a but just just for the sake of


anything thing I'll throw them an


a because they are a


classic lays classic oh


man


[Music]


o oh


man I know y'all are saying s but I


can't put them in s because they're not


better than uh than Cheeto


puffs chat listen I I I could put these


in s but they're not better than Cheeto


puffs are so due to that they go in


second place second place in


a unless y'all want to move Cheeto puffs


up here and
