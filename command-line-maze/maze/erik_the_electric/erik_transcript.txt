I'm letting food companies control


everything I eat for the next week only


99 waffles


left today is day number one for the


next 7 days I'm not just going to find


out how many of the world's biggest food


companies will reply to my DMs should my


next meal be 200 or 300 Oreos I'm going


to see for myself which ones will


challenge a guy like me to eat insane


meals reply with a pizza emoji and I'll


eat every Douro Pizza my grocery store


has in stock I can tell you these


companies read these messages pick a


number between 10 and 20 whatever you


choose will be how many bowls of your


cereal I got to eat because I did a


challenge like this earlier this year


with fast food companies and while I got


some pretty big meals I once ate a


25,000 calorie bowl of Cheetos and it


was the most


Miser marvelous experience of my life


double tap this message and I'll do it


again just based on how many calories


were in the first meal of this week's


challenge I had a feeling that the next


s days were going to be even crazier how


many cans do you think I should eat hope


you'll reply to this I'm a huge fan of


your


[Music]


let's get


cracking to fully complete this


challenge I have to follow three


important rules rule number one I can


only eat what food companies tell me I


can eat rule number two is where it's


going to get interesting because I have


to finish each challenge I get there's


so many


nuts that's what she said on the same


day I get


it if I fail to finish each food


challenge or food challenges before


midnight then then I have to double the


next challenge I get most amount of nuts


eaten in one


sitting okay I'm just going to pretend


like I didn't see that the final rule is


the most important one this bowl of nuts


is never ending because this challenge


is only


complete if every challenge I get is


finished before the 7even days are up


just based on how I felt only 20 minutes


into the first challenge I could tell


this week was going to get crazy I got


to admit I underestimated this challenge


but fortunately the day is still young


had I known how much sodium I was about


to get bombarded with over the next few


days I would have at least tried to


enjoy this cold sweet chocolate milk way


more than I actually


did we're back in business with a little


less than 4 hours left until


midnight my strategy was to use the


sweetness of the chocolate milk to get


down the rest of the nuts there is 60 g


of protein in one of these cans and even


though I felt like I just put my jaw


through the workout of a


lifetime I was finally starting to see


some progress the last thing I thought


would be eating at the start of this


week with 177,000 calories of nuts and


only a few minutes later I saw the light


at the end of the tunnel I finally see


the


bottom before this challenge I was a


lover of all nuts peanuts cashews


almonds you name it but after the last


few hours let's just say I had a change


of heart there's going to be a long time


before I'm going to be able to look at


another handful of nuts the


same other than my own of


[Music]


course I just want to let you guys know


something very important do not not


attempt anything you're about to witness


me do yourselves I am a trained


professional today is going to be a very


long


day Red Baron what did I even send to


them Domino's challenged me to eat 10 of


their pizzas a few months ago think I


can eat 11 of


yours today it's going to get pretty


cheesy as soon as I got home I realized


that the hardest part of this challenge


wasn't just how much pizza I was going


to have to eat eat it was the time I was


going to have to eat it in cooking 15


frozen pizzas was going to take a long


time but after getting halfway through I


got a completely unexpected surprise in


my


inbox why would they want my address is


it weird to give a company your address


I wasn't really sure what Red Baron was


going to send me so I sent them my PO


Box


address at least I'm burning some


calories


the good news is I've been cooking pizza


for so long that I'm actually hungry


again the bad news is it's almost 5:00


p.m. and I have 15 pizzas to eat getting


these pizzas down in a little under 7


hours was going to be nearly impossible


but with how delicious the first pizza


tasted I began to think that maybe time


wasn't going to be an issue after


all pizza number one is down I started


on the classic pepperoni pizza


next Red Baron M and after getting


through half I was even more confident


until I looked up and mentally processed


how much pizza was actually on my


table comment below what your favorite


pizza topping is I'm asking that even


though we all know pineapple is the


worst I got into the Mexican style pizza


next which was my new


favorite I made sure to enjoy it as much


as I could because what I had to eat


next I wasn't looking forward to


honestly I can tolerate burnt pizza


Fitness fitting this piece of burnt


pizza in my


mouth that's literally fire but when


you're trying to eat 15 pizzas in less


than half a day there's one thing the


body isn't so good at tolerating lactose


all the cheese from these pizzas was


hitting my stomach harder than a reality


check after a midnight Taco Bell run


I've lost count how many pizzas I've


eaten already that was not good and with


only a few hours left in the day I knew


getting another DM and having another


challenge to finish would mean an


instant fail what's also not good is it


feels like World War 7 is going on in my


stomach right


now just forget I just said that my


number one priority was to get these


pizzas down as quickly as possible but


the only way I was going to be able to


do that was to fix whatever was going on


in my stomach before it was too late I


got to admit it'd be very foolish for me


to continue on without doing something


that I should have done before the start


of this challenge at first this was the


standard midf food challenge grocery


store trip until I realized I was


literally walking around in public with


a shirt that said professional idiot on


it my only hope at finishing these


pizzas was lying in the hands of this


lactate I have to find out how fast


acting this


is back in


business


hopefully I might need some extra help


with only a few hours left in my my


stomach fighting back in this battle


between me and Red


Baron it was pretty clear that I was


losing big


time so much so that I decided to bring


some additional exertion to the party to


avoid flavor fatigue as much as possible


I choose


you this stick also came in quite handy


too pizza number six was the deep dish


pepperoni flavor I was actually a big


fan of the taste but the one I had next


I was the least excited about for


obvious


reasons I have burned some pizzas in my


life but that my friends and family is


absolutely hideous my only hope at


saving this pathetic excuse for a pizza


was to use some garlic Ranch okay it's


been


saved as I got into pizza number seven I


was finally picking up momentum again


starting to see a lot more comments


lately about people wanting to know how


I stay in shape and I'm going to give


you all my secret right now are you


ready for it this is how I cut


carbs but unfortunately that momentum


was shortlived well everyone I've made


it halfway through that's about the only


thing I have going for me because right


now I feel like I'm swimming through an


ocean of pizza oh my goodness there's so


much pizza man once I finish pizza


number eight come on Pizza get over here


I knew that if I had any chance at


finishing these before midnight my


stomach was going to need a timeout I


have a little bit less than 4 and 1/2


hours until midnight so I'm going to


take a little break and go lay on the


couch like a


beach there's a lot of Pizza in


here gu something all right I had a 38


in stomach before I started this


challenge let's see where I'm going to


be at now


there's no way think I should eat 150 or


200 of your donut


holes thanks in Tans but I don't really


believe in serving


sizes with 6 and 1/2 pizzas left the


flavor fatigue was unbearable I'm going


to need something


stronger but thanks to some wow sauce my


taste buds were once again


reignited now it was going to come down


to stomach capacity which I was quickly


running out of feel like my blood type


is


mozzarella oh I am absolutely disgusted


with myself right


now excuse me all right what did I say I


was at 38 in wish I could say the same


for something


else okay believe me just add that to


the world an extra 4 in on my waist in


just two days holy [ __ ] oh my goodness


this is typically where I'd go have some


ice cream or do something to counteract


all the salt i' just eat but since one


of the rules is I could only eat what


companies tell me to eat that was


completely out of the question so much


but there was one thing I could


do don't knock it till you've tried it


ladies and gentlemen after seeing honey


on Pizza a few times over the years oh


my goodness I couldn't think of a better


opportunity to try


it the Honey woke my taste buds up like


a double shot of espresso on a Monday


morning but as I finished pizza number


11 my body was clearly fighting back and


with less than an hour and a half until


midnight I knew this was going to be


close oh man I am not doing very well


right now oh my goodness I hate pizza so


much right now after an hour of


digestion time I was going to give these


last three pizzas everything I had it's


not for one final


push actually this isn't the final push


the final push will be tomorrow morning


midnight was a little over 10 minutes


away and no amount of Honey or sweetness


was going to fix the gastrointestinal


nightmare that was going on in my


stomach I have a not so good headache


right now it's clearly your body trying


to tell you to stop feeding at 17,000 lb


of pizza like what are you thinking I


was able to slowly work my way through


pizza number 11 but unfortunately the


possibility of failure was now becoming


a


reality when the one pizza I was in love


with only a few hours ago tasted like


sadness wrapped in melted cheese I knew


that this was officially over well


everyone it is 12:00 midnight and I


failed to finish all the pizzas which


means the next challenge I get I have to


double at this point it felt like I had


ingested about 20 days worth of salt I


have nothing else to say I'm completely


disgusted with myself which is why when


I saw what challenge popped up next dear


Skippy huge fan how many jars do you


think I can eat I wasn't very


happy but what showed up later took me


by complete surprise for the second time


in a row I was going to be getting


something from a company choose my next


snack should I eat 50 or 100 Hot


Pockets Red Baron's message from the day


before was a bit more vague and I wasn't


quite sure if they were going to send me


food or something else the message I got


from Hot Pockets however seemed a little


bit different sounds good here's my


address since it was pretty clear that


Hot Pockets was going to to be sending


me food I gave them my home address all


I can say is I hope they don't send the


pepperoni pizza


flavor I am so over pizza right now I


sat down to try and finish as much of


the leftover pizza as I possibly could


but after getting through only two


slices the salt was already destroying


me you guys got to comment down below


are you team cold pizza or are you team


hot pizza right now I'm team no pizza my


goal was to finish off the leftover


pizza and then move on to the next


challenge of the day but with just one


pizza left I decided to save it and move


on to the Skippy challenge anyway I'm


going to head back to the store I went


back to the nearest grocery store AKA


Walmart and a few minutes after walking


in I was struck by a rather Pleasant


looking birthday cake this birthday cake


reminded me of something that every man


over 30 hates being reminded of my


birthday was just 2 weeks away I didn't


really think much of it until my gaze


fell upon this marvelous wall of


Pop-Tarts and when I saw the confetti


cupcake flavor I remembered what I spent


an entire morning trying to get my hands


on only a few weeks before this it all


started when I opened up IG and saw that


Pop-Tarts had dropped a rare and


extremely limited edition item big


enough to feed 73 people how well


Pop-Tarts only made a few of them and


you could only buy one if you live in


New York Los Angeles or Chicago this


item is called the party pastry now as


someone that's pretty experienced in


eating oversized Foods when I saw that a


bunch of people had gotten their hands


on something this epic before me I'm not


going to lie I felt a little left out so


I went on pop- tart's website and tried


to order one for myself and I saw


this I hadn't felt fomo this bad since I


was 10 years old standing in line for


hours at the midnight release of the


fifth Harry Potter book I was just a few


feet from the register when I heard the


three words no young Harry Potter Super


Fan man should ever hear we're sold out


all of my friends talked about it for


the next week me I plugged my ears and


pretended like I didn't care but in


reality missing out on the novelty of


something new and exciting while other


people around me got to experience it


was pretty devastating since my


birthday's coming up and the Pop-Tart is


literally called the party pastry maybe


I could get Pop-Tart to send me one if I


was going to find out though I was


probably going to need to fix my first


message to them double tap this if you


think I should eat 50 Pop-Tarts in 5


minutes I promise I won't fail I always


finish on time


I'd Like My Birthday Cake to be your


giant Pop-Tart I know it's sold out any


chance I could buy a leftover one so I


can eat it in my next video now all that


was left for me to do was wait oh and


eat two jars of


Skiby apparently I got a package I plan


on grabbing the package after I was done


with the next


meal it was time to get to work on the


peanut butter shout out to Skippy as


soon as I took my first bite I got some


pretty crazy flashbacks of me eating


that giant bowl of nuts from day one


matter right which is why I decided to


take a little detour a few minutes later


first jar is


down that detour was to grab my package


at the UPS store which I figured could


only be from Red Baron after I did that


I decided it was time for a sugary


beverage this has nothing to do with the


video everybody but I just want to say I


love I love that okay I need to eat


there sometime all right I just want to


clarify that one of the most important


rules of this challenge is that I can


only eat what food companies tell me to


eat I can drink whatever I want to drink


can I just get the uh sugariest drink


you you guys have on the menu after


seeing this really cool license plate I


want one of those oh thank you very much


I got this really cool looking beverage


called the summer Skies drink this


tasted like it had every kind of berry


mixed inside of it woo oh man life is


back which Honestly made me a little


less disgusted with myself that is until


I started shoving down spoonfuls of


peanut butter once again only a few


minutes later but thankfully though I


was able to finish off the second jar


Skippy second jar is down I actually


kind of lucked out there could have been


a lot


all right this was completely unexpected


dear spam how many cans would you


recommend for a first time spam tryer


with my kind of


appetite I think I know why I woke up


with no dams this morning it's because I


have my spam filter


on that was a really dumb


joke time to eat some spam like 10,000


calories of it being fully honest I


wasn't super excited about this one


mainly because I've never had spam


before cheers but after the first bite


that was not bad I was not only taken


back by how tasty it was but how salty


it was first container of spam is down


that was turns out that each container


of spam has roughly 3,000 mg of sodium


per


can I just consumed 1.5 days worth of


salt there was no way around it I just


had to keep eating hot and spicy flavor


and I also had to hope no other


challenges showed up not bad it was


right about here where I realized that


eating spam straight up was just not


going to cut it I was going to need to


innovate a little bit you know I'm going


to do everybody I'm innovate here with


some spam pizza at first using spam as a


pizza topping sounded like a solid


plan all right this are not going very


well until I remember that frozen pizzas


have equally as much sodium as a can of


spam well the good news is our pizza's


dumb feel like I just dumped a bottle of


soy sauce on my tongue


I'm uh going to be calling it quits for


right now because I


I as I took my dog Apollo for a walk I


knew there was no way people just ate


spam straight out of the can so I did


some research and I'm really glad that I


did all right everybody well I think I


know of a way that's going to make this


more


palatable turns out that while spam is a


pre-cooked meat the majority of people


that eat Spam eat it cooked with things


like eggs and rice which unfortunately I


wasn't able to do but what I was able to


do was change the consistency of it even


though I was putting my trust in a few


internet strangers I was willing to do


whatever it took to finish the spam


because failing another challenge simply


wasn't an


option the chocolate milk got me through


all those salty nuts on day one so I


decided to use it as my beverage for


this meal we all know I could use the


sugar and don't worry all right it's 1%


slow fat just trying to was my


[Music]


figure to my complete and utter surprise


this fried spam completely blew me


away that completely just changed the


game wow wow wow I'm a big texture guy


so those crispy edges made a world of


difference 8 out of 10 even though the


hickory smoke spam was incredible hey


this is gluten-free the sodium was


starting to become an issue again 7 out


of 10 get into the flavor I'm most


excited about we have the Teriyaki


spam n out of 10 that was Sensational


side note I really wish I could try this


this looks really really good spaming


eggs if you've had it before let me know


Down Below in the comments


six uh seven out of 10 on that one feels


like a science experiment is going on in


my stomach right now with all the sodium


I've eaten after some digestion time on


the couch I was happy to see an empty


inbox I came back a little while later


with 30 minutes left in the day to


finish off the last three cans oven


roasted


turkey this tastes like turkey bacon


after finishing both the oven roasted


turkey and the regular spam I got to the


flavor I was most curious about the


maple


spam wow this stuff's amazing after


finishing the spam there was only one


thing left to do before the day could


officially end ladies and gentlemen


after today I consider myself an expert


in spam and that's saying a lot coming


from someone like me who has over


120,000 emails sitting in his


inbox no I'm not


kidding now I saved this moment


specifically for right now because I


wanted to have something to look forward


to that's actually pretty sick I got an


oven mitt from Red Baron oh I got a


letter too what is this they gave me a


bunch of free Red Baron pizza slips that


is so awesome shout out to Red Baron for


the free pizza in the oven mitt now if I


could only get a reply from


poptart well no response from Pop-Tarts


and the other 100 companies are messaged


I made the mistake of sending a bunch of


companies follow-up messages when I


first did this challenge a few months


ago I won't be making that same mistake


this time I really do want that pop-art


though dear Pop-Tarts it's my birthday


soon and I want your giant Pop-Tart to


be my cake could you send me one I'm


filling with excitement just thinking


about


it I wasn't lying I am excited I'm also


very


constipated hi there can I get one tall


iced coffee please I'm not going to give


you all full visual because this video


probably wouldn't be allowed to be on


YouTube if I did that but Bo has been


stopped up need a little help awesome


thanks so much have a good day and no I


don't take cream or sugar with my coffee


cuz I like it


black just like my


soul holy sh should my breakfast be 50


or 75 EO


waffles hopefully they reply I really


want some


WAFF only 99 waffles


left I ate 100 egos back in 2018 but


trying to eat 100 again while in the


middle of a 7-Day eating challenge was


without out a doubt going to be much


harder for me syrup was my best friend I


don't want anybody to panic all right


don't worry the syrup is sugar-free


come on you didn't think I would


actually use sugar-free syrup for the


entire 100 waffles did


you I dedicate this to all the beautiful


people in


Canada as far as I was concerned this


challenge was going much better than I


expected and I swear nothing goes better


together than waffles and coffee it's


even more delicious when you're drinking


it out of the world's best coffee mug be


sure to grab an iHeart carbs mug along


with all the other iHeart carbs


merchandise Lincoln bio before I knew it


I was already onethird of the way


through the massive pile of waffles but


if I was going to make it through all


100 I was going to need more than just


maple syrup speaking of syrup I knew I


was going to have to bring some back up


to the party one of the biggest mistakes


I made when I did this challenge a few


years ago was not coming prepared with


enough syrup so I got some strawberry


syrup there's nothing like strawberry


syrup on a nego


waffle or in my case 15 ego waffles but


that was just the first combination I


had a few more tricks up my sleeve


I also got some blueberry syrup honestly


I'm more of a strawberry syrup kind of


guy but this was a nice change for my


taste bus the last combo was the sole


reason I grew up 50 lb overweight oh and


I also got some Hershey syrup while this


did taste legendary and I only had about


36 waffles left I remembered that I


could get another challenge at any time


and while it was still noon I knew that


if I got another Red Baron size


Challenge and failed it I most likely


wouldn't get lucky like I did with the


Skippy challenge but after all the salt


I'd eaten over the last few days the


sugar from these waffles was everything


my taste buds wanted I have what looks


looks like 10 waffles left I could wait


on this but I'm not going to take any


chances no more waffling


around but little did I know the


sweetness was just


beginning that was a lot of sugar


because the DM that showed up next took


me by complete


surprise like this message and I'll eat


every Pillsbury cookie flavor in my


grocery store bet you


won't well Pillsbury liked my DM now


it's time for me to find out how much


I'm going to dis like myself after today


is over the good news is that Walmart


didn't have a crazy amount of pillsberry


cookie flavors in stock the bad news is


that pillsberry doesn't just sell


cookies in the refrigerated section


anymore a challenge is a challenge and I


had three more boxes of cookies to eat


but first I had to make the refrigerated


ones and while they didn't turn out like


the pizzas from a few days ago they did


come out looking rather


interesting even though I was still


sugared out from the last meal I always


get excited when I see new products from


companies so I decided that for this


meal I was going to try something new


I've decided to do something I've never


done before in a video I'm going to be


doing my first tier list to put it


simply a tier list is a ranking system s


being the highest and F being the lowest


good old sugar cookies we all know sugar


cookies are a


classic they've never been an absolute


favorite of mine so for that reason I


put those in Beacher I moved on to the


Oreo cookies next which I was very


excited about these rang all my


bells now these are good but they


definitely definitely definitely need


some milk optimal dunking time I'm


definitely more of a 10-second guy now


even though that last statement could be


taken in a completely different


way I got back to work on the rest of


the Oreo cookies but only a few minutes


later I heard the one sound I really did


not want to hear comment down below are


you team chewy cookie or are you team


crispy


C there is no it's 9:00 at night man


should my next meal be 250 Nutter


Butters or the world's tallest Nutter


butter while this may have seemed like


just another automated reply it was the


second DM I'd gotten from a company


after 7:00 p.m. that was quite the scare


utter butter which told me that anything


could show up at any time over the next


72 hours and I had to be prepared for it


I'm going to put those in a tier they


would be S tier if I was actually still


coherent to make things worse I was


experiencing the beginning stages of


something we're all familiar with a


sugar


crash there so many cookies if you made


it up into this point in the video drop


a cookie Emoji Down Below in the


comments so after powering through these


chocolate chip cookies I knew what had


to happen next chocolate chip cookies


are an S here unfortunately everybody


these are going to have


to after attaching myself to my couch


yet again I was happy to see an empty


inbox now all that was left for me to do


was finish the last three mega- siiz


boxes of cookies at this point my taste


buds were about as invested in this meal


as I am in a salad at and all you can


eat buffet Funfetti pillsberry


cookies it tastes like a birthday cake


I'm surprised I can still St out right


know but with only three boxes of


cookies left I was almost at the finish


line is there a c tier I am so


unbelievably over sugar right now at


this point I felt like my pancreas was


now Willy Wonka's chop-up factory and it


was working over


time it was tast like sugar at this


point sorry


brother I literally feel like I'm him


right now Pillsbury if you'd like me to


be your next spokesperson you know where


to find


me I have one package left and there's h


no way I can continue right now oh my


goodness with how full I was at this


point I I knew that failing another


challenge and having to double up on


another meal would make finishing this


7-Day challenge impossible after over an


hour of recovery time all that was


standing in my way between Victory and


defeat was one final box of


cookies my taste buds are so confused


right now I got to say if I would have


eaten these without having 100 EG of


waffles and 5,000 calories of cookies


sitting in my stomach they probably


would have been my favorite I usually


love the taste of Cinnamon Toast Crunch


cook right now it's the last thing I


want in my life


I don't even want to know how much sugar


I 67,8 40 g of sugar just kidding I


haven't eaten that much sugar but it


definitely feels like


it ladies and gentlemen I've made it


past the halfway point and I only have 3


days left the next morning I checked to


see if Pop-Tarts had messaged back when


I saw no response I was ready to give up


until I realized I was going to get a


second chance to get the mega poptart


holy [ __ ] they're doing another one of


all the days it was not only today but


it was being released in less than 5


minutes the footage you're about to see


I'm not proud of


but this is me spending the next 20


minutes trying to order the giant


Pop-Tart on pop- tart's


website which was about as functional as


a sloth playing speed chess after trying


for another 10 minutes I saw the one


thing I was hoping I wouldn't


see


die why is this so difficult I've looked


everywhere I've gone on eBay I've gone


on Facebook market place I've gone on


every possible site to try to find this


Pop-Tart so I can have an epic birthday


this year what you're about to see me do


is pathetic but I want a legendary


birthday cake and I'm willing to do


anything to get it just tried for 20


minutes to order one for my beat day but


the site crashed on me any chance I


could get one left over it'd be the best


birthday present ever now that that's


out of the way and I have no challenges


in my inbox I should probably do


something productive


today leaving me on red come on Snickers


really I thought we were friends I


expected a DM to show up in my inbox


within the next few hours but when the


late afternoon rolled around I was


surprised to see an empty inbox a few


hours later I checked again and was even


more surprised to see I still had


nothing but as night time approached


that was about to


change I'd like to eat a ridiculous


amount of your candy how many bags


should it


[Music]


be why is this so difficult I just want


the poptart my birthday is coming up and


I think giant poptart would make the


perfect forget it at this point I


officially gave up my quest for the


party pastry I assumed I'd have another


day of no challenges but I was very


mistaken I'm kind of freaking out right


now everybody poptarts didn't reply but


a company equally as big and equally as


cool just it I just can't remember what


I said to them I ate


10,540 calories of cinn and toast crunch


back in the day double tap this and I'll


do it again I promise I won't flake out


life is like a bll of cereal it's great


at first Until you realize you're


drowning in it and there's no way


out and that was pretty


sad to eat exactly 10,540 calories of


Cinnamon Toast Crunch I had to be as


precise as possible which is why I


brought out the food scale oh my gosh I


was genuinely worried that this bowl


which was actually an upside down


plastic container meant for a massive


cake wasn't going to be big enough come


on baby come on come on come on come


on all right there we go everybody


2,638 G is just around


10,540 calories worth of Cinnamon Toast


Crunch oh God and since it' been almost


2 days since my last meal I decided it


was time to make things just a bit more


interesting if I can beat my old record


and get this down in under 37 minutes


then you got to subscribe if you're not


subscribed already if I can't finish


this in under 37 minutes then I'll


automatically have to double the next


challenge I get once it hits 203 I'm


going to start I'm a big believer in


breakfast being a hands-on


experience but in all seriousness there


was a reason why I was eating the cereal


dry every single time I do giant cereal


challenges milk always tends to get


everywhere I probably could have made


this way less complicated by just eating


this in separate bowls but it definitely


wouldn't have looked as cool after


getting through the first few handfuls


it was finally time for the milk I


always enjoyed reading the back of the


cereal box as a kid


but as an adult it's a bit different


there's 12 g of sugar and one serving of


this the wildest part is that this was


just the beginning 16 G of whole gr per


serving because the next day and a half


was going to be the craziest part of the


week 11 minutes in all my taste buds


wanted was something bitter or savory


man I really wish I would have


remembered to buy coffee at the


store no excuse me and then I heard the


sound I really didn't want to


[Music]


hear should I eat fish 50 or 60 pbjs for


lunch thanks Sarah Lee I'll keep that in


mind the sugar was wrecking my taste bus


I knew I needed Salt ASAP and that's


when it finally hit me like I just


dumped a bottle of soy sauce on my


tongue this is going to look weird


everybody but you know what I got to get


some salt in I know it probably seems


really weird to eat a spoonful of soy


sauce but the salt kicked my taste buds


back into gear like getting hit with


cold water when you thought it was warm


all right well the good news is I can


actually see the bottom now bad news is


I feel like I'm no longer on planet


Earth anymore with 2,000 calories of


cereal and less than 15 minutes left I


used spoonfuls of soy sauce to get me


through each sugary bite but that was


taking up valuable time 4 minutes left


at this point it was less about the


sugar and more about me trying to forget


about how painfully soggy this giant


bowl of cereal had become but only a few


minutes later I finally saw a light at


the end of the


tunnel I made sure to get every crumb I


could see back in the bowl and as soon


as I saw that I only had a few minutes


left I knew that all I needed to do to


finish this challenge was to Pace myself


ladies and gentlemen with 3 minutes to


spare that has been 10,540 calories


worth of sing Toast Crunch that was very


sweet it' be even more sweet if you


subscribed if you're not subscribed


already I took Apollo out for a walk a


few hours later and even though I was


still drunk off sugar I was so relieved


to see an empty inbox but unfortunately


for me I was about to hear from a


company that I had hoped had forgotten


about


me well it looks like Hot Pockets didn't


forget about me


okay well I guess they're definitely


sending me Hot Pockets I didn't give Red


Baron my actual address but it looks


like I'm going to have to give Hot


Pockets my real address hopefully


whoever is running the Hot Pockets


account isn't a Serial cuz that wouldn't


be good my bad that was my PO Box here's


my address looking forward to seeing


what it


is even though I'm kind of not looking


forward to seeing what it is all I knew


was that on the final day I was going to


be getting some hot pockets I just hope


that if I got another challenge


alongside the Hot Pockets it would be


something I could manage all right Bri


it is 11:55 5 minutes left in the day


I'm going to check the DMS one last


time I am so happy to see an empty inbox


right now well everybody tomorrow is the


final day and all I got to say is that


if I do end up getting another brand in


my inbox besides Hot Pockets for my own


sanity I hope that it's nothing


sweet Duncan hindes why can't even


remember what I said to them looking to


make a high calorie dessert for my next


eating challenge how many boxes of your


cake do you think should be in


it how many calories are even in eight


boxes of


cake 20,000 calories or something like


that having to finish 20,000 plus


calories of cake mix along with whatever


Hot Pockets was sending me was going to


be close to Impossible and if another DM


showed up this entire weekl long


challenge was as good as over but all I


could do at this point was focus on the


challenge in front of me and that's when


I try to remember why I use the words


high calorie dessert instead of just


saying looking to make a high calorie


cake when dming Duncan Hind until it


finally hit me this is the standard size


for grocery store cupcakes now could


these get any


smaller giant cupcake


pin yeah but do I really


need these will probably never get used


but they are cool


as you're about to witness me commit a


crime it's called legalized


prostitution so dumb I reluctantly began


to make eight mega- siiz cupcakes and


that's when I got the one thing I was


waiting for the entire


week I can't believe this is happening I


finally have a reply from Pop-Tarts hi


there we'd like to send you as a pretty


good preview all


right awesome here's my address looking


forward to seeing what it is is whatever


they send me obviously it's not going to


be today I just hope it gets here before


my


birthday these cupcakes are going to be


big


ass if I can get these eight megga siiz


cupcakes down before midnight tonight


then this challenge will be complete if


I was going to finish these cupcakes and


complete this challenge I knew I was


going to need a strategy I was also


going to need some


napkins unfortunately the only strategy


I could use here was to Pace


myself and to use the bitterness of the


coffee to get through each sugary


cupcake that was actually pretty good


maybe this challenge won't be so bad


after all I instantly regretted that


last statement as soon as I bit into the


next cupcake and after making it halfway


through cupcake number two I came to the


realization that I was going to have to


come up with something because there was


no way I was finishing all eight of


these cupcakes before midnight the


second cupcake is down the first thing I


had to do I'm already sugared out was


fix the flavor fatigue I genuinely hope


none of you try or attempt anything


you've seen in these videos at home


leave it to the trained professional


idiots as I got into cupcake number


three I used spoonfuls of soy sauce to


fight off the flavor fatigue each


tablespoon of soy sauce hit my taste


buds about as hard as a cannonball dive


at a quiet pool party but unfortunately


I was filling up very


fast was not


good I wasn't even anywhere near the


halfway point I feel like my blood is


made up of literal frosting right now as


much as I didn't want to admit it I knew


there was no way I was finishing what


was on my table before


midnight I am in dire need of something


very important right now so I'm going to


go try to get that and also try not to


to think about the fact that I have


something else that's supposed to show


up


today feel like after this week Walmart


should ban me I thought getting out of


the house to grab some milk would help


take my mind off of things but when I


got back and saw the table full of


cupcakes again and also heard this


noise I remember there was just one


thing I hadn't tried yet I'm about to do


something downright diabolical but


desperate times call for desperate


measures


Breakfast of Champions all essential


nine minerals and vitamins oh jeez


I well let's try a sip shall


we yum the next cupcake on my list was


the red velvet flavor which typically I


really like when I have normally


functioning taste


butts at this point the sugar was


clearly affecting more than just my


digestion halfway through our fifth


cupcake fourth and to make things worse


the cupcake sitting for as long as they


had been made them really dry but just


as I was starting to get momentum back


again feel like it's taking me 6,000


years to eat this cupcake I heard the


second sound that I really didn't want


to hear it's like has me to swow that's


what she said this sh is so


scary oh


here I was expecting a Hot Pockets


delivery man but what was actually on my


doorstep was a Walmart bag with hot


pockets in it I decided to set the Hot


Pockets aside and shift my focus back to


the gigantic cupcakes which were only


getting harder and harder to


eat I feel like that's my life right now


and to think that I actually thought


this week would be a piece of cake I was


only able to make it halfway through the


next cupcake before I decided that


enough was enough I can barely even sit


at this table and look at these cupcakes


anymore it's goodness it's huge I think


my stomach has a vein CU I have so much


food in it I laid on my couch for about


another hour before trying to sit down


again for round three which was just a


bit too


soon I hate cupcakes so much right now


the only thing I wanted was salt I do


anything for something Savory Burger


some potato chips or some and that's


when it hit me oh I completely forgot


about that


[Music]


all I got to do is just get the last two


cupcakes


down I got 21 minutes it's hard to put


into words how disgustingly fool I was


in this moment but I knew the only way I


was going to be able to get the win was


by using the Hot Pocket strategically to


eat these cupcakes win or lose it is my


birthday in a week it would be the


greatest birthday wish ever if you gave


the video a like oh my sweet goodness


literally strawberry cupcakes are


usually my favorite because when I eat


them I can feel slight better about my


poor Life Choices knowing that there's


probably less than 1% fruit inside these


could have been the best strawberry


cupcakes ever made but I still would


have wanted anything else in the world


at this point spicy garlic chicken and


bacon thankfully these Hot Pockets were


magical for the first time in days it


felt like all was right in the universe


again was your best thing I've ever eat


in my life maybe I liked it a little too


much but with a little over 10 minutes


left I had to eat and I had to eat


quickly you know it's standing in my way


of these two hot pockets and this


absurdly large cupcake every ounce of my


sugar filled Soul wanted nothing to do


with this cupcake but I saved the last


two hot pockets for that exact reason


with time running out this entire weekl


long challenge was less than 7 minutes


away from being over a little over 6


minutes


left I stuffed each bite of cupcake back


like I was trying to win a gold medal in


questionable Life Choices until all that


was left was just one cupcake quarter


and one hot


pocket I grabbed the last piece of the


cupcake like I was a quarterback


throwing thr the winning touchdown pass


and even though each bite was torture


with a little over 1 minute remaining in


the entire


challenge victory was


mine but this challenge wasn't fully


complete until it was midnight I'm


assuming no more DMS are going to come


in but I'll wait anyways as the Clock


Struck midnight and I saw no more DMS


had come through the only thing running


through my mind was what Pop-Tarts was


going to be sending


me happy birthday Eric sorry we couldn't


save you a party pastry we hope you


enjoy these


instead you've got to be kidding me
