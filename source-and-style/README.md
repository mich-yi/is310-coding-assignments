# Inspecting the Cultural Web

## Website Selected
Google Arts & Culture  
https://artsandculture.google.com/


I am investigating the Google Arts & Culture website, which our group identified as one of the newest digital libraries/archives related to our digital object. 


## Web Technologies Observed

It appears that HTML, CSS, and Javascript were all involved in building this tool. There are files that end in .css and .js, and the page itself seems to be built with HTML. A file type that I do not recognize is .woff2, but seeing as these files are under the “Font” filter, I assume this is a font-related file type.



## Who Built the Website?

This website describes itself as a “non-commercial initiative” that works with cultural institutions and artists around the world. The text in the About page also clarifies that there is a team behind the website that works with partners to manage the collections on the website. However, it does not seem to be publicized specifically who and how many people were involved with the website.
